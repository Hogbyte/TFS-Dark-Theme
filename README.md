# TFS-Dark-Theme

CSS "borrowed" from various styles from https://userstyles.org/
(see individual CSS files under the Styles folder for the source credit)

Instructions:
1. Install the TamperMonkey extension in your browser of choice.
2. Copy/paste the code from the UserScript.txt file into a new TamperMonkey script.
3. Update the @match URL to match to your on-premis TFS instance.

Notes:
- Tested using the TamperMonkey extension for Edge.
- Will likely work for other browsers, or other extensions (example: GreaseMonkey).
